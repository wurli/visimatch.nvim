# visimatch.nvim

A tiny plugin to highlight text matching the current selection in visual mode ðŸ’«

Highlights are updated whenever the visual selection changes, but visimatch
manages to do this without noticeable lag by only searching/applying highlights
to the *visible* regions of buffers. This means that visimatch will continue to
work smoothly even when editing very large files. It's magic!

## Installation

Using Lazy:

``` lua
{
    "wurli/visimatch.nvim",
    opts = {}
}
```

## Configuration / Features

Here's the default configuration:

``` lua
-- Pass this to require("visimatch").setup() or use it as the `opts` field
-- in the Lazy.nvim plugin spec above
opts = {
    -- The highlight group to apply to matched text
    hl_group = "Search",
    -- The minimum number of selected characters required to trigger highlighting
    chars_lower_limit = 6,
    -- The maximum number of selected lines to trigger highlighting for
    lines_upper_limit = 30,
    -- By default, visimatch will highlight text even if it doesn't have exactly
    -- the same spacing as the selected region. You can set this to `true` if
    -- you're not a fan of this behaviour :)
    strict_spacing = false,
    -- Visible buffers which should be highlighted. Valid options:
    -- * `"filetype"` (the default): highlight buffers with the same filetype
    -- * `"current"`: highlight matches in the current buffer only
    -- * `"all"`: highlight matches in all visible buffers
    -- * A function. This will be passed a buffer number and should return
    --   `true`/`false` to indicate whether the buffer should be highlighted.
    buffers = "filetype",
    -- Case-(in)nsitivity for matches. Valid options:
    -- * `true`: matches will never be case-sensitive
    -- * `false`/`{}`: matches will always be case-sensitive
    -- * a table of filetypes to use use case-insensitive matching for.
    case_insensitive = { "markdown", "text", "help" },
}
```

## Limitations

Note that visimatch won't trigger in situations where the cursor doesn't move.
In particular, this means that entering `viw` when the cursor is already at the
end of the word won't trigger visimatch. In such situations, just move the
cursor and highlights will trigger ðŸ’« NB, this is a limitation of Neovim which I
don't think is worth adding a workaround for yet. Hopefully this will eventually
be [addressed](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/19708) on the vim/Neovim
side.
